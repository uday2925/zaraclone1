How We Build The ZARA Website Clone?

Hi reader, you might have visited, read, or heard about ZARA international, which is a Spanish apparel retailer based in Spain. The company specializes in fast fashion, and products include clothing, accessories, shoes. ZARA is one of the big players in the fashion and clothing industry and the world's largest apparel retailers.

Moving on ahead, we(team "Hustle") at masaischool.com developed the clone on Zara's Official Website in just 5 days as a part of our first construct week in Masai School. This blog is all about what are all things we used?, How do we do it? , what challenges did we face? , and how we overcame those challenges?

TECHNOLOGY STACK WE USED
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap

Yes, I know what you might be thinking. How is it possible to make the clone with just 3 technologies? We can, as we have just started our humble journey to learn full-stack web development at the Masai school, we just knew these technologies so far. As per our curriculum, we were assigned to build a fully functional website using the technologies we learned so far. And we believe we accomplished this task to the best of our ability.
HOW DO WE DO IT?
Before answering the big question of " how we did it? ", let me show you some snippets of our website.
Now answering the big question of how we did it, I would like to say that it is because of the guidance of our captain Chandrashekhar & our dedication towards making the website pixel perfect, I and my wonderful teammates had, able to achieve our goal. As part of Masai school, we have always believed that communication and skills are greater than knowledge so it is because of effective communication and sheer will to understand complicated things and make them simple to understand, we were able to create the page with comparatively fewer resources.
This would not be possible without the guidance and support from IA's and EC's who were there for us whenever we ran into any issues or were demotivated.
Last, but of course not least, our fellow team members who gave their 100% and worked day and night, willing to learn new things and collaborated so well together so we could achieve this result.
Challenges We Faced And How We Solved Them

As it was the first time for us to collaborate remotely on a project. We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
Git was fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to merge the code and solve the conflicts. We overcame this, by following a specific command structure on when to commit and merge things to the branch. Once we figured that one out, everything worked seamlessly.
Another challenge was solving the problem of redundant CSS classes. It happened sometimes that there were few redundant classes and the output used to get disoriented. We overcame this challenge by setting rules and guidelines on how should we name our classes and functions so that they won't interfere with each other.
There were some new design standards and features to be met, specifically on the home page of the website. So implementing that was a challenge, we have to make use of UI libraries to achieve the proper result.
Implementing functionalities such as the cart feature was somewhat of a challenge by itself.

Ending note And Takeaways.
As mentioned earlier, we were able to attain the required layout because of the communication that we maintained. The command chain that we follow and the level of understanding about the topic we had. I felt proud to work with such amazing people and represent the team in the evaluation. This project could not have been made possible without the contribution of our team members - Uday Kiran Reddy Katta, Devendra Kumar Thalasila, Muhammed Nasif, Ankush Dhiman, and Tushit Saxena.
